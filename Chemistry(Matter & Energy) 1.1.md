### What is matter?
matter is all around us it's liquids, solids and many in between but all you have to remember is that matter is made up of atoms and atoms determine what kind of form matter takes.
***
#### Gas
Remember if the atoms are far apart that means it's a gas, think of gas as something like smoke or steam coming out of a train or rocket.
***
#### Liquid
Remember liquid is when the atoms are far apart but clumped in small groups, think of like a colony of ants taking up different roles so splitting off into groups or separate train carts holding a certain amount of passengers, that's basically what the atoms are doing in a liquid.
***
#### Solids
Remember that solids are a bunch of atoms squeezed tightly together in an orderly fashion, think of like a line of military solders walking in a parade or like a bunch of men in suits  standing in an elevator in an orderly fashion.
****
Remember matter is anything that has mass and occupies space, remember mass is just something that means it has weight or size to it like a planet basically or a bowling ball or like a toy block.

Also matter and energy go hand in hand like peanut butter and jelly and they're like both the two basic components of the universe. if they weren't im pretty sure we would not exist lol.
***
#### Hey can matter change forms?
well of course they can, it's matter I'm pretty sure if it couldn't we'd all be in trouble, but did you know when matter changes forms it's called a *change of state* or *phase change* yeah I know pretty cool! Did you know the best way to change a state of matter is by heating it up or cooling it?

### Explanation 
###### Think like this if you freeze water it becomes a solid but if you boil it like hell it becomes a gas, eventually you can get it back to a liquid by simply just cooling the air around you and I know what you're thinking and no you cant fill a room with water by boiling then turning it into a gas then filling in the air then immediately turning the room cold but you can make the room really wet which i guess is fun in a way!
***
### Ok that's cool and all but how does freezing a liquid turn it solid?
well think of it like this when you get cold you get slower and less energetic right, and most likely you'd want to huddle up in a blanket or next to someone to stay warm right? Well that's basically what the atoms do and eventually that liquid becomes a solid, in other words you took all the atoms energy and made them huddle together therefore turning them into a solid or in this case the water...
***
### Well that makes sense  but then how does turning a liquid into a gas work?
Think of it like this if you give a group of kids candy they all get excited and energetic then start running all over the place, essentially they went from a liquid to a gas in other words the atoms are heated up and energized to the point where they freaking burst apart from each other and then that liquid turns into a gas. Think of the candy as the source of heat and the atoms as the kids running around full of energy like the atoms.

### Summarizing the change in the elements
Ok we all know that water is H2o in other words it has 2 hydrogen atoms(h2) and 1 oxygen atom(o) but did you know it's still h2o even if it isn't a liquid, that's right, water is still water even if it's frozen or a gas but did you know there is a special way to summarize if h2o is in a gas or liquid state and all you have to do is label it as h2o(s), h2o(l) or h20(g) the s stands for solid, the l stands for liquid and the g stands for gas.
***
### Ok but sometimes I don't see certain things go from liquid to gas but rather solid to gas explain that?
Well that my friend is called ***Sublimation*** now I know what you're thinking "Sub-what" and to that i say Sublimation is when a solid goes straight to a gas, like those little white scented balls your mom or grandma throws around her house to make it smell good or those solid air fresheners that look like candy [^trust me you don't want to eat those] those go from a solid to a gas and never reach a liquid phase and you know how i said when you give a liquid a lot of energy they tend to shoot all over the place and become a gas that's basically what this is except the solid just goes ***POOF*** and boom it's a gas it's basically like a line of children running all over the place once they get into a playground.
##### BY THE WAY DID YOU KNOW THE ELEMENTAL STRUCTURE OF DRY ICE IS CO2 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CARBON DIOXIDE
***
### PURE WHATS!!!
well scientists like to organize things alot so it's not surprising that they'll organize ***substances*** and ***mixtures*** for example a pure substance is something like salt or sugar [^6 by the way salt on the periodic table is NA otherwise know as Sodium]
***
### Pure Substance
ok but what makes a pure substance you may ask and to that I say... a pure substance is made from an element and compound.

* ***Elements:*** are made up of a single kind of atom for example something like salt(Na) as i said previously or gold(Au) basically thats what makes it well it no matter how many times you completely destroy gold you'll still have gold, by the way the atoms in elements all have the same protons.

* ***Protons:*** protons are just a subatomic particle of an atom.

* ***Compounds:*** A compund is basically just composed of 2 or more elements in a **SPECIFIC** ratio think of water or in this case h2o it has 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom and remember if you add even one more hydrogen or oxygen atom it no longer becomes water.
***
### Mixtures
Mixtures are basically just pure substances that have no consistent composition like mixing ravioli noodles in tomato sauce in other words they-re easy to separate, like putting a mixture of oil into water no matter how many times you mix it, the oil will always be at the bottom because they're heterogeneous.. and speaking of heterogeneous lets talk about it along with homogeneous.

* ***Homogeneous:*** Homogeneous mixtures just mean that the 2 solutions have a similar composition like paper and construction paper, like mixing water and sugar or like a kool-aid packet into water everything basically goes together and are really hard to tell apart from one another.

* ***Heterogeneous:*** It's basically just the complete opposite of what homogeneous is think of it like mixing sand in water, you cant, you can try but you can't because the sand does not like complying with the water and is very heavy like a fat woman trying to sit on a plastic children's chair or a muscular man trying to sit on a children's chair the chair doesn't comply with their weight so it snaps.
