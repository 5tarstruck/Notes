####  WAAAAAAA!!! 1-4
Don't worry this is easy and quick my friend just remember if there is an **odd** number of negatives the answer is **negative** and when there is an **even** number of negatives the answer is **positive**
***
#### Example 1-4
-2 * (-10) * 8 = 160
-4 * 10 * 8 = [-320]
-40/-4 * 3=30
-144/12 * -2= [-24]
***
#### Yeah that was easy to understand! 1-4
Told ya, just remember odd number of negatives = negative and even number of negatives = positive. It's as simple as that!
***
#### Recap 1-4
If the negatives are odd then the answer is negative  if the negatives are even then the answer is positive!!
