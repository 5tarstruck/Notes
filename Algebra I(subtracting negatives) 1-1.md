#### Hey how do I subtract negative numbers? 1-1
Oh that think of it like this, how would you subtract normal numbers? Usually its like this right
(100-90=10) or (90-100=-10) subtracting negatives is basically the same thing, but instead yours doing it with negative numbers. so here are some examples okay!
***
#### Example 1-1
-12 -(-22) = 10
-100-(-12)=[-88]
-10-(-34)= 24
-90-(-4)=[-86]
***
#### Example 1-1 explanation
So I know what you're thinking, "Hey why are some positive but others are negative?" to simply put it think of it as like subtracting non negative numbers if the smaller number is in front or above the larger number that results in the answer being a negative! 1-2=[-1] remember that in negative notation the farther away from 0 the number is the smaller it becomes no matter how you look at it **[-100]** will always be less than **[-1]** as simple as that.

#### Recap 1-1
subtracting two negatives is like subtracting two positives and the number closest to 0 being written/typed first results in the answer being positive while the number farthest from 0 being typed/written first results in the answer being a negative.
