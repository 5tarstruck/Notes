### HOLY CRAP YOU CAN TURN FRACTIONS INTO DECIMALS!? 1-5
YES!!! You can now stop yelling, now all you have to do is divide the numerator[Top number] and denominator[Bottom number].
***
### Example 1-5
9/12 = 0.75
10/3 = 3.33
20/100 = 0.2
69/12 = 5.75
98/6 = 16.33

### Ok that was too easy is there a catch? 1-5
as far as I have read no there isn't that's pretty much it...yep so let's just get to the recap then...
***
### Recap 1-5
if you're faced with a decimal and want to turn it into a fraction then just divide the numerator and denominator that's as easy as it gets...

### I Feel a storm coming 1-6
Oh boy you're right now it's getting fun MWAHAHA now i know what you're thinking **AHHH BUT WHAT IF I WANT TO TURN A FRACTION INTO A DECIMAL!!!** Well my curious friend that's pretty simple all you have to remember is all the numbers to the right are the numerator [except the 0's] and all the numbers to the left are the denominator... I know hard to grasp but don't worry we got this!!! [^oh yeah and remember however many 0's there are is the amount of 0's you have to add after you put 1]
###### OH YEAH I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT YOU NEED TO SHORTEN THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR BY THE SAME DIVISIBLE NUMBER !!!!
***
### Example 1-6
0.0023 = 23/1,000
0.00898 = 898/1,000 -> 499/500
0.098 = 98/100 -> 49/50
****
### that wasn't too bad I guess! 1-6
Yeah but remember to always try and shorten the number if you can in order to get a reasonable fraction but if you can't just keep it as it is!
***
### Recap 1-6
["If the number is a decimal then all you have to do is put the numbers to the right[except 0] in the numerator and the numbers to the left in the denominator...Hey they can't all be catchy!!"]
***
### Repeating what!? 1-7
well it's the same as turning decimals into fractions but instead you just put the repeating number once then you put 9 down however many times it repeats.
***
### Example 1-7
0.989989989 = 989/999 -> 43/333 (not divisible by 9)
0.182343182343182343 = 182,343/999,999 (not divisible by 9)
0.454686454686454686 = 454,686/999,999 (not divisible by 9)
***
### These are hard to shorten 1-7
Certain numbers can't be repeated by the same number due to certain numbers not being divisible by the same number, remember that the fraction can only be shortened if both the numerator and denominator are divisible by the same number
***
### Recap
##### NO RECAP NECESSARY IT'S LITERALLY THE SAME AS THE FIRST HALF
