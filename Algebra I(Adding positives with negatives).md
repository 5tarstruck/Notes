#### OMG YOU CAN ADD POSITIVE NUMBERS WITH NEGATIVE ONES!? 1-2
Well of course you can. Remember how we subtracted 2 negative numbers to get a positive or negative result? (-1-(-2)=[1]) or (-10-(-5)=[-5]) yeah this is basically just the same but with addition and negative/positive numbers!
***
#### Example 1-2
6+(-7)= [-1]
9+(-10)= [-1]
-8+10= 2
-12+20= 8
***
#### Ok why are some numbers negative? 1-2
Lets put it in an easier way then if the **[negative is written/typed before the positive]** the answer will be **[positive]** and if the **[negative is written/typed after the positive]** the answer will be **[negative]** simple right?!
***
#### Recap 1-2
we know we can add positive and negative numbers and we know if the positive number is first then the result is negative and then the inverse happens if the negative number is first.

### QUICK MATH SPEED RUN!!!
this is basic math so this part is easy!!!
***
### EXAMPLE!!!
1+1=2 
1+2=3

all you need to remember is this lil ol rhyme!
["The sign of the sum is the SAME AS THE SIGNS"]
i told you it was basic!
